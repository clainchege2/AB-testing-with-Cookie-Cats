## AB-testing-with-Cookie-Cats

**The libraries used**

- python
-pandas

**Motivation:**

Im a very big fun of games, expecially FIFA. This project was inspired by the desire to understand how gaming designs impact the popularity and play time of various game products. So i searched for data on kaggle and found a popular mobile game called **Cookie Cats**. The game data had very compelling questions that i pick ineterest on exploring:
  What is the distribution of the game rounds?
  What is the probability of difference between gate being at level 30 and level 40?
  Where should the gates be placed?

**Files:**

cookie_cats.csv - data file in csv format
notebook.ipynb - jupyter notebook of the project
cookie cats.png	 - an image shot of the game

**Summary:**

The bootstrap result tells us that there is strong evidence that 7-day retention is higher when the gate is at level 30 than when it is at level 40. The conclusion is: If we want to keep retention high — both 1-day and 7-day retention — we should not move the gate from level 30 to level 40. There are, of course, other metrics we could look at, like the number of game rounds played or how much in-game purchases are made by the two AB-groups. But retention is one of the most important metrics. If we don’t retain our player base, it doesn’t matter how much money they spend in-game.
